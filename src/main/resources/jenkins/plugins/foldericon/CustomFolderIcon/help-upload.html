    Upload an image to represent the folder.<br/>
    Use the "Browse..." button to select an image from disk.<br/>
    You can crop the image to the desired result and upload it using the "Apply" button.<br/>
    The file name will be randomized during upload.<br/>
    You can also select an image from the list of the already available icons.<br/>
    <br/>
    The recommended minimum size of the image is 128x128 pixels.<br/>
    The image will be deleted automatically if this folder is being deleted - unless of course it is still used by another folder.
